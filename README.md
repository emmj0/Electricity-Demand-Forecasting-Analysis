# Electricity Demand Forecasting & Analysis  

## 📌 Overview  
This project focuses on analyzing and predicting electricity demand using regression modeling and time series analysis. The dataset is preprocessed, visualized, and modeled to identify trends and patterns.  

## 🚀 Features  
- Data Cleaning & Preprocessing  
- Outlier Detection (IQR & Z-score)  
- Time Series Analysis (ADF Test, Trends, Seasonality)  
- Regression Modeling (Linear Regression)  
- Model Evaluation (MSE, RMSE, R² Score)  

## 🛠️ Tech Stack  
- Python, Pandas, NumPy  
- Matplotlib, Seaborn (Visualization)  
- Statsmodels (Time Series Analysis)  
- Scikit-Learn (Machine Learning)  

## 📂 Files  
- `q1.ipynb` → Jupyter Notebook with full analysis.  
- `final_cleaned_data.csv` → Processed dataset.
